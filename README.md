# Biomodd-BRG13_ESP32

ESP32_Biomodd.ino

This sketch runs on an ESP32 with an ADS1115 ADC sensor attached and is reading and transmitting the voltage generated by a Winogradsky column.

Typical voltage range is between -300mV to +300mV but varies per column.

The ADS1115 has a programmable gain and currently set to (GAIN_ONE), resulting in a 0.125mV resolution with a maximum reading of +/- 4.096V.
It is important not to exceed these voltage limits by VDD +0.3V.


The resulting value(s) can be pushed to Biomodd.xyz, a ThingSpeak channel or other services. This example pushes to both mentioned channels. 


Edit the following lines according to your own account/credentials:

For Biomodd.xyz (check the latest required format there):

String serverPath = "https://biomodd.xyz/push?author=YOURNAME&device=DEVICE&sensor=SENSORNAME";

The sensorvalue is added in this line, with 0.125 (GAIN ONE) resolution:

serverPath +=  String(adc0 * 0.125);

For ThingSpeak:

String apiKey = "YOUR API KEY";

For IFTTT:

tba...

Make sure that the sketch does not push not too much data in a given amount of time.
Edit the following line to the amount of milliseconds needed:

unsigned long timerDelay = 60000;
